# SilverStripe Sermon Series Creator

This is my first SiverStripe module to enable people to build a church web site using SilverStripe.  This module will allow a sermon series to be added and displayed for a church. 



## Requirements

* SilverStripe ^4.0
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (6.x) and [npm](https://npmjs.com) (for building
  frontend assets)
* Other module
* Other server requirement
* Etc

## Installation
Add some installation instructions here, having a 1 line composer copy and paste is useful. 
Here is a composer command to create a new module project. Ensure you read the
['publishing a module'](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/developer_guides/extending/how_tos/publish_a_module/) guide
and update your module's composer.json to designate your code as a SilverStripe module. 

```
composer require heartlandtechie/sermon_series 4.x-dev
```

**Note:** When you have completed your module, submit it to Packagist or add it as a VCS repository to your
project's composer.json, pointing to the private repository URL.

## Documentation
 * [Documentation readme](docs/en/readme.md)

Add links into your docs/<language> folder here unless your module only requires minimal documentation 
in that case, add here and remove the docs folder. You might use this as a quick table of content if you
mhave multiple documentation pages.

## Example configuration (optional)
If your module makes use of the config API in SilverStripe it's a good idea to provide an example config
 here that will get the module working out of the box and expose the user to the possible configuration options.

Provide a yaml code example where possible.

```yaml

Page:
  config_option: true
  another_config:
    - item1
    - item2
  
```
